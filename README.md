# Data Engineering Capstone Project

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview

This is a capstone project for the Udacity DataEngineering Nanodegree. The purpose of the data engineering capstone project is to give you a chance to combine everything learned throughout the program.

### 1.2. Goal

The objective of this project was to create an ETL pipeline to form an datalake about immigrants destinations in US. The analytics database could be used to find immigration trends at US destination cities. For example, do temperatures, city demographics, airports affects the number of people immigrating to a city in the US.

### 1.3. Datasets

We are going to work with 4 different datasets and try to combine them in a useful way to extract meaningful information:

* I94 Immigration Data: This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. A data dictionary is included in the workspace. [This](https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html) is where the data comes from. There's a sample file so you can take a look at the data in csv format before reading it all in.
* World Temperature Data: This dataset came from Kaggle. You can read more about it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).
* U.S. City Demographic Data: This data comes from OpenSoft. You can read more about it [here](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/).
* Airport Code Table: This is a simple table of airport codes and corresponding cities. It comes from [here](https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes#data).

All data for this project was loaded into my S3 bucket.
